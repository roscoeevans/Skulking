# Project Conventions

## What This Is

A private, mobile-only game web app. The UI must look and feel like Apple marketing material — premium, confident, immersive. Every pixel should feel intentional.

## Platform Rules

- **Mobile only.** Design for 390px–430px viewport width. No desktop layouts, no tablet breakpoints.
- **Light mode only.** No dark theme. Glass surfaces assume a bright, colorful backdrop.
- **Portrait orientation.** Landscape is not supported.
- **PWA-ready.** Use `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">` and respect safe areas.

## Tone & Voice

- **Apple marketing tone.** Short, declarative sentences. Confident, not clever. No exclamation marks, no emoji in UI copy.
- **Verb-forward labels.** "Play Again" not "Click here to replay". "Share Score" not "Score sharing options".
- **Minimal copy.** If it can be communicated with an icon and a word, do that.

## Design Philosophy

1. **Content over chrome.** The game IS the experience — UI should frame it, not compete.
2. **Every surface is glass.** If something has a background, it should be translucent with blur.
3. **Brand gradient as the canvas.** The spectrum gradient (amber → rose → sky) is the backdrop. Glass floats on top of it.
4. **Depth, not decoration.** Shadows and layers communicate hierarchy. Don't add ornamental elements.
5. **Animations serve the game.** Motion should celebrate wins, cushion losses, and guide attention.

## Technical Preferences

- Keep dependencies minimal — this is a simple app.
- Vanilla CSS custom properties for theming (no Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS unless framework requires it).
- Semantic HTML where possible.
- SVG for icons — inline, not icon fonts.
- Images optimized as WebP with fallbacks.

## File Organization

```
/src
  /assets       — SVGs, images, fonts
  /styles       — Global CSS, tokens, reset
  /components   — Reusable UI pieces
  /game         — Game logic and state
  /pages        — Screen-level views
  index.html
```
